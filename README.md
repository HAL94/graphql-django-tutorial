# graphql-django-tutorial

## A Django GraphQL starter from Graphene Tutorial
This is a sample project that I followed from the Graphene Docs Tutorial which can be found from Graphene(https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/installation/)
The project is done with the latest version of Django which is 4.0.4 as of today (16th May 2022)

## What's in this project?
A simple CRUD app that will list **Ingredients**, and the **Categories** for which these ingredients belong to. 

There are two CRUDs for categories and ingredients with a many-to-one relationship between category and ingredient.
